# Summary

This DIP describes an off-chain API v2 ping command that makes it easier for clients to detect network and protocol problems.

# Abstract

To improve the ability of off-chain service handling network problems and protocol errors, we’d like to introduce a ping command for client to:
1. detect dead connections to a remote off-chain service.
2. measure the latency to a remote off-chain service.
3. detect off-chain protocol errors to a remote off-chain service, for example: an off-chain service responds back with an unexpected compliance key due to key rotation, this can be leveraged to debug and verify the inconsistency.

# Specification

The PingCommand object's definition:

| Field       | Type | Required? | Description                  |
|-------------|------|-----------|------------------------------|
| _ObjectType | str  | Y         | The fixed string PingCommand |


An example `CommandRequestObject` JSON message with `PingCommand`:

```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandRequestObject",
    "command_type": "PingCommand",
    "command": {
        "_ObjectType": "PingCommand",
    },
    "cid": "12ce83f6-6d18-0d6e-08b6-c00fdbbf085a",
}
```

And the response of the `PingCommand`:
```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandResponseObject",
    “status”: “success”,
    "cid": "12ce83f6-6d18-0d6e-08b6-c00fdbbf085a"
}
```

Note, PingCommand does not require a random payload, as the Off-Chain Protocol already has a `cid` to uniquely distinguish different `CommandRequestObject` and `CommandResponseObject`.

This command introduces no new errors outside the scope of [DIP-1](https://dip.diem.com/dip-1).
