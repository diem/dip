title: P2M Charge Payment - Off-Chain Protocol
authors: Yinon Zohar, Daniel Prinz, David Wolinsky, Dimitri Roche
status: Draft
type: Standard
created: 03/15/2021

# Summary
This DIP leverages the off-chain protocol defined in [DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx) and extends it to enable P2M Charge payment.

This DIP defines the type of the P2M payments, corresponding requests and the payment structures. 
 
This DIP does NOT include payment flows which require funds pull pre-approval such as subscription and recurring payments. 

This DIP makes use of the `result` field added to the `CommandResponseObject` as described in [DIP-161](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-161.md)

This DIP makes use of the `PaymentMetadata` enum as described in [DIP-10](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-10.md#on-chain-transaction-settlement)

---
# Abstract / Motivation
This DIP is an extension of the Off-Chain Protocol to support more advanced payment functionality - particularly eCommerce P2M Charge payment.
Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured and the existence of a corresponding transaction on-chain. 

## How P2M Payments Differ from P2P Transfers 
There are several key differences between the process of paying a merchant (P2M) and a simple P2P transfer:
||P2M|P2P|
|-|-|-|
|**Payer Data**|Customer details are required for **every** payment / purchase in order to perform risk checks and apply AML policies|Required only for transfers for which Travel Rule applies. i.e., over 1000 USD|
|**Payment Owner**|The merchant, i.e. the receiver of funds, "drives" the process and determines the payment details|The payer, i.e. the sender of funds, determines the nature of the transfer|
|**Reconciliation**|The merchant requires a way to correlate the transfer of funds to a payment or payment request for reconciliation purposes|No reconciliation|

---
# Glossary
For the sake of simplicity, we use the following terms:
* "Sender", "Payer", "Wallet" or "customer VASP" - The customer's wallet. It is the VASP representing the customer. This is the VASP that will send the funds and eventually will submit the on-chain transaction to the blockchain
* "Receiver", "Receiving VASP" or "Merchant VASP" - The VASP representing the merchant which receives the funds (transaction)
* "Customer" - The person who wishes to pay the merchant for goods or services
* "Reference ID", "Common Payment Identifier", "Payment Identifier" - A unique identifier of the payment. It must be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included. See also [Reference ID in DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx#terminology)
---
# Prerequisite: Sharing Payment Identifier and Receiver Address
A prerequisite for the off-chain negotiations is that both parties (sending and receiving VASPs) have shared a common payment identifier and the receiver address. This common payment identifier is required to support a successive off-chain protocol between the VASPs. 
This DIP specifies a couple of examples for exchanging identifiers between VASPs, however, there could be others. The protocol is agnostic to the method of exchanging the common payment identifier. 

See [Appendix A](#appendix-a---prerequisite-sharing-common-payment-identifier-and-address)

## High-Level Flow and Payment Types
---
The high-level flow of an eCommerce P2M payment is:
1. On the merchant's checkout page the customer chooses to pay with Diem
2. The merchant transmits the payment details to its VASP (receiver VASP) so the latter can generate a payment request with Diem  
3. The receiver VASP generates a payment request with all details needed and provides it to the merchant, so the latter can display the Diem payment details in the checkout page
4. The customer triggers the payment by performing the required actions in the checkout page, e.g. by scanning a QR code
5. The sender VASP parses the payment request (e.g. parse the information encoded in the QR code) and uses the provided payment identifier to get the payment details. This is the first step of the off-chain protocol
6. The wallet then presents the requested payment details to the customer so the customer can review the payment
7. The customer approves the payment request in the wallet
8. The wallet initializes the payment protocol (off-chain) which will end (if successful) with the funds being charged and a corresponsing transaction was put on-chain. Successful completion implies that the receiving VASP was satisfied with the payer information provided and the sender VASP was satisfied with the merchant information provided. **Note** that if the payment amount exceeds the amount that requires a dual attestation signature (i.e. above Travel Rule threshold), the receipient signature must be provided to the sender, so the latter can include it in the on-chain transaction submitted.  

### **Charge Payment Type** 
Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured.
As soon as the funds are captured, i.e. the sender and receiver agreed to the payment terms, the sender VASP is expected to submit a corresponding transaction on-chain and actually transfer the funds. 

### **Other Payment Types (future)**
Protocols supporting other eCommerce payments flows will require additional payment types which will be be defined in future DIPs.
Some examples for such flows are:
* Auth / Capture
* Subscription payment
* Recurring payments

---
## Sender / Receiver Interface
---
This section describes a set of functionalities / activities that should be made available by a Sender and Receiver VASPs in order to support P2M Charge flow based on this DIP. Each functionality can be conceptually compared to an API endpoint. Similar to API documentation, it includes the expected input and output for each functionality.

## Command Types
The following is a list of new values for the `command_type` field of the `CommandRequestObject`. Each command type denotes a step in the off-chain negotiations and specifies the data of the request and response 
* `GetPaymentInfo` - Allows obtaining payment information based on reference id
* `InitChargePayment` - Initializes a payment process of type `charge`. Triggering this command by the wallet means the customer approved to proceed with the payment and that the wallet is satisified with the business infromation provided. Successful response from the receiver means that the receiver is satisfied with the payer data provided by the wallet 
* `AbortPayment` - Aborts a payment

| Command Type |Direction| Description | Request Data | Response Data |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|[GetPaymentInfo](#getpaymentinfo)|Sender > Receiver|By providing the object reference id the wallet can retrieve the object information from the receiving VASP. In most cases, this would be the first command sent by the wallet. The wallet is not expected to provide any payer data at this stage|Reference ID|Payment Details ; Business Data|
|[InitChargePayment](#initchargepayment)|Sender > Receiver|This functionality allows the wallet to init the payment process based on the payment details. This is likely to occur after the customer approved the payment request and the wallet verified the business data|Reference ID ; Payer Data|(optional) Recipient Signature|
|[AbortPayment](#abortpayment)|Sender > Receiver / Receiver > Sender|This functionality allows both parties to abort the payment outside the standard flow of the protocol|Reference ID||

---
## Payment Sequences
---
This section describes the expected sequences in P2M scenarios.
Each scenario is expressed using a sequence of Sender / Receiver functionality.

**Reminder:** Before this scenario starts, an exchange of a common payment identifier (Reference ID) must be completed. 

### Charge Sequence
| Step | Command Type | Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargePayment|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data|
|3|Put transaction on-chain|Sender|Following a successful response from the receiver (to the InitChargePayment in the previous step), the wallet must put a corresponding transaction on-chain and include the Reference ID as part of the metadata. See [appendix B](#appendix-b---include-reference-id-in-the-on-chain-transaction). If the payment is over the travel rule threshold, the sender must verify the recipient provided its signature as part of the InitChargePayment response|

**Note** that following the completion of the Charge sequence, the receiver should start looking for the transaction put by the sender on the blockchain

### Risk Checks Failed (Init Payment Error)
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargePayment|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data.  Risk checks failed. Receiver will respond with PaymentCommandErrorObject where the error_code is `risk_checks_failed`|

### Abort Sequence - Customer Rejected the Payment Request
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|AbortPayment|Sender|Customer decided not to approve the payment based on the information displayed. The abort_code is `customer_declined`. It is recommended to include a descriptive abort_message|

### Abort Sequence - Merchant Data Checks (performed by the Sender) Failed
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data|
|2|AbortPayment|Sender|Sender decided to abort. Can happen if the sender does not approve merchant data provided by the receiver. The abort_code is `business_not_verified`. It is recommended to include a descriptive abort_message|

### Abort Sequence - Insufficient Funds
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data|
|2|AbortPayment|Sender|After getting the payments details from the receiver, the wallet verifies the customer has sufficient funds to complete the payment. If not (and the customer cannot/does not top up the account balance), the wallet should respond with AbortPayment. The abort_code is `insufficient_funds`. It is recommended to include a descriptive abort_message|

### Abort Sequence - Missing Recipient Signature
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargePayment|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data. Since the payment is over the travel rule threshold, the wallet expects a recipient signature as part of the response|
|3|AbortPayment|Sender|After getting the payments details from the receiver, the wallet verifies the recipient signature exists. If not, the wallet should respond with AbortPayment. The abort_code is `missing_recipient_signature`. It is recommended to include a descriptive abort_message|

### Abort Sequence - Could Not Put Transaction On-Chain
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargePayment|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data|
|3|AbortPayment|Sender|After getting the payments details from the receiver, for some reason, the wallet is not able to put the transaction on-chain. The wallet should respond with AbortPayment. The abort_code is `could_not_put_transaction`. It is recommended to include a descriptive abort_message|

Note that this is a prerequisite for the off-chain negotiations and not a part of it.

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using Redirect URL

This URL contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier) and the wallet's website address.

The redirect URL is likely to be used in the **Web Redirect** flow which means that the customer will be redirected from the merchant's checkout page to the wallet's website to review and approve the payment. 

The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into a series of URL parameters appended to the query string.

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|redirect_url|str|N|Encoded URL used by the wallet to redirect the customer back to the merchant|

For example, for the following values:
|Field|Value|
|-|-|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|
|redirect_url|http%3A%2F%2Fsomemerchantnname.com%2Fcallbackpage|


The URL format would be:

`https://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411&redirect_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsomemerchantnname.com%2Fcallbackpage`


After parsing this request, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the customer to review and approve. 

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using QR Code

Similar to the URL, the QR code contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier).

The QR Code is likely to be used in the **QR Scan** flow, which means that the customer will use the wallet app on the mobile device to scan the QR code on the merchant's checkout page. Following the QR code scan, the wallet app will display the payment details for the customer to review and approve the payment. 

The QR code is a representation of a deeplink.
The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into the QR code deeplink. 

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-----|----|---------|-----------|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|redirect_url|str|N|Encoded URL used by the wallet to redirect the customer back to the merchant|

For example, for the following values:

|Field|Value|
|-|-|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|

The deeplink represented by QR code would be (the domain and path are examples - the real wallet domain/path should be used):

`diem://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411`

After scanning the QR code, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the customer to review and approve.

# Appendix B - Include Reference ID in the On-Chain Transaction

In order for the receiver VASP to be able to correlate the on-chain transaction to the off-chain payment, the sender VASP must include the Reference ID in the on-chain transaction metadata.
Using the Reference ID for correlation, the receiver VASP can, for example, verify that the amount in the on-chain transaction matches the off-chain payment amount.

The Reference ID must be added to the PaymentMetadata element defined in [DIP-10](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-10.md#on-chain-transaction-settlement).
```
enum PaymentMetadata {
    PaymentMetadataV0(ReferenceId),
}
type ReferenceId = [u8, 16];
```
