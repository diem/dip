# Summary

This DIP describes a protocol standard for sender initialized pre-flight exchange using reference ID to form payment transactions.

Reference ID is used as a unique identifier for a payment transaction between two VASPs. 
We define a standard for doing a sender-initiated pre-flight exchange of a reference ID between VASPs to agree on a reference ID for a transaction.
The sending VASP first defines a reference ID and the receiving VASP responds back with a success or failure indicating whether this reference ID can be used to define this transaction.
Once they agree on a reference ID, the sending VASP can submit an on-chain payment metadata transaction containing only this reference ID, removing the need to include any potentially identifiable user information in the transaction.


# ReferenceID Exchange
Transactions with PaymentMetadata require a ReferenceID in order to submit a transaction to the chain. PaymentMetadata reveal nothing distinctly about either the sender or receiver and do not create a linkability between the sender or receiver across payments. Hence, the ReferenceID must be established off-chain and this protocol defines one such way to do so leveraging DiemID.

A VASP intending to send a payment to another using DiemIDs constructs a ReferenceIDCommand and transmits it to the receiver. If the receiver knows the recipient DiemID and can potentially accept payments, it returns a success. Otherwise, it returns an error indicating the reason.

In the case that the amount to be sent would exceed the limit of the travel rule, the sending party should follow this exchange with a PaymentCommand using the same reference_id and specify the sending and receiving subaddresses as all 0.

The format of the command is:

```
{
   "_ObjectType": "CommandRequestObject",
    "command_type": "SenderInitiatedReferenceID",
    "command": {
	    "_ObjectType": "SenderInitiatedReferenceID",
	    "sender": "alice",
	    "sender_address": "dm1pptdxvfjck4jyw3rkfnm2mnd2t5qqqqqqqqqqqqq305frg",
	    "receiver": "bob",
	    "reference_id": "5b8403c9-86f5-3fe0-7230-1fe950d030cb", 
    },
    "cid": "12ce83f6-6d18-0d6e-08b6-c00fdbbf085a",
}
```

**CommandRequestObject:**

| Field 	    | Type 	     | Required? 	| Description 	           |
|-------	    |------	     |-----------	|-------------	           |
| _ObjectType   | str        | Y | Fixed value: `CommandRequestObject`|
| command_type  | str        | Y | Fixed value: `SenderInitiatedReferenceID`|
| command       | Command object | Y | The Command to request. In this DIP, refers to ReferenceIDCommandObject |
| cid           | str         | Y            | A unique identifier for the Command. Should be a UUID according to [RFC4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) with "-"'s included. |

**ReferenceIDCommandObject:**

| Field 	    | Type 	     | Required? 	| Description 	           |
|-------	    |------	     |-----------	|-------------	           |
| _ObjectType   | str    | Y | Fixed value: `SenderInitiatedReferenceID`|
| sender        | str          | Y            | Sender's full DiemID |
| sender_address| str          | Y            | Sender's onchain [account identifier](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-5.md) with subaddress set to `None` or the zero subaddress|
| receiver     | str          | Y            | Receiver's full DiemID |
| reference_id  | str          | Y            | Reference ID of this transaction to be included into payment metadata |


The format of the success response is:
```
{
   "_ObjectType": "CommandResponseObject",
    "status": "success",
    "result": {
	    "_ObjectType": "SenderInitiatedReferenceIDResponse",
	    "receiver_address": "dm1p7ujcndcl7nudzwt8fglhx6wxn08kgs5tm6mz4us2vfufk",
    },
    "cid": "12ce83f6-6d18-0d6e-08b6-c00fdbbf085a",
}
```

**ReferenceIDCommandResultObject:**

| Field 	    | Type 	     | Required? 	| Description 	           |
|-------	    |------	     |-----------	|-------------	           |
| _ObjectType   | str        | Y | Fixed value: `SenderInitiatedReferenceIDResponse`|
| receiver_address       | str | Y | Receiver's onchain [account identifier](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-5.md) with subaddress set to `None` or the zero subaddress |

#### Error Codes

`duplicate_reference_id`: Duplicate Reference ID was rejected by the receiving end

`invalid_receiver`: Receiving end could not find the user with the given user_identifier

`invalid_field_value`: Reference ID is in the wrong format. See more details in [DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx#request-object-validation-error-codes)

## On-Chain Transaction Settlement
If the amount is below the travel rule limit, the sending VASP can send a p2p transaction with PaymentMetadata and the `reference_id` VASPs agreed on to settle the transaction.
```
enum PaymentMetadata {
    PaymentMetadataV0(ReferenceId),
}
type ReferenceId = [u8, 16];
```

If the amount is at or above the travel rule limit, VASPs should trigger an off-chain protocol for KYC exchange. The same `reference_id` must be used to perform a travel rule exchange as described in [DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/master/dips/dip-1.md).
