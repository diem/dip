# Summary
This DIP leverages the off-chain protocol defined in [DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx) and extends it to enable eCommerce P2M payments (Peer To Merchant) of the following types:
* Charge
* Auth / Capture

This DIP defines the type of eCommerce P2M payments, corresponding requests and the payment structures. 
 
This DIP makes the Auth/Capture section in [DIP-8](https://dip.diem.com/dip-8/#authcapture) redundant. The auth/capture section in DIP-8 is to be disregarded and will be removed in a future version of DIP-8. 

This DIP does NOT include payment flows which require funds pull pre-approval such as subscription and recurring payments. 

This DIP makes use of the `result` field added to the `CommandResponseObject` as described in [DIP-161](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-161.md)

# Abstract / Motivation
This DIP is an extension of the Off-Chain Protocol to support more advanced payment functionality - particularly eCommerce P2M payments. 
## How P2M Payments Differ from P2P Transfers 
There are several key differences between the process of paying a merchant (P2M) and a simple P2P transfer:
||P2M|P2P|
|-|-|-|
|**Payer Data**|Customer details are required for **every** payment / purchase in order to perform risk checks and apply AML policies|Required only for transfers for which Travel Rule applies. i.e., over 1000 USD|
|**Payment Owner**|The merchant, i.e. the receiver of funds, "drives" the process and controls the type of payment and its timing. For example, the merchant will decide when to capture the previously authorized funds and whether to capture the entire payment amount or only partial amount |The payer, i.e. the sender of funds, determines the nature of the transfer|
|**Reconciliation**|The merchant requires a way to correlate the transfer of funds to a payment or payment request for reconciliation purposes|No reconciliation|

## P2M Payment Types
There are two types of P2M payments described in this document: 
1. **Charge**. Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured 
2. **Auth / Capture**. Auth / Capture payment, as the name suggests, means that the payment is divided to two steps: Authorization and Capture. Successful Authorization implies that the funds are locked so they can later be captured
---
# Glossary
For the sake of simplicity, we use the following terms:
* "Sender", "Payer", "Wallet" or "customer VASP" - The customer's wallet. It is the VASP representing the customer. This is the VASP that will send the funds and eventually will submit the on-chain transaction to the blockchain
* "Receiver", "Receiving VASP" or "Merchant VASP" - The VASP representing the merchant which receives the funds (transaction)
* "Customer" - The person who wishes to pay the merchant for goods or services
* "Reference ID", "Common Payment Identifier", "Payment Identifier" - A unique identifier of the payment. It must be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included. See also [Reference ID in DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx#terminology)
---
# Prerequisite: Sharing Payment Identifier and Receiver Address
A prerequisite for the off-chain negotiations is that both parties (sending and receiving VASPs) have shared a common payment identifier and the receiver address. This common payment identifier is required to support a successive off-chain protocol between the VASPs. 
This DIP specifies a couple of examples for exchanging identifiers between VASPs, however, there could be others. The protocol is agnostic to the method of exchanging the common payment identifier. 

See [Appendix A](#appendix-a---prerequisite-sharing-common-payment-identifier-and-address)

## High-Level Flow and Payment Types
---
The high-level flow of an eCommerce P2M payment (regardless of the type) is:
1. On the merchant's checkout page the customer chooses to pay with Diem
2. The merchant transmits the payment details to its VASP (receiver VASP) so the latter can generate a payment request with Diem  
3. The the receiver VASP generates a payment request with all details needed to identify this payment later in the process, provides it to the merchant and makes it available to the customer's Diem wallet (the customer's VASP or sender)
4. The sender VASP parses the payment request (e.g. by scanning the payment request QR) and uses the provided payment identifier to get the payment details. This is the first step of the off-chain protocol
5. The wallet then presents the requested payment details to the customer so the customer can review the payment
6. The customer approves the payment request in the wallet
7. The wallet initializes the payment protocol (off-chain) which will end (if successful) with the funds being authorized or charged (depending on the payment type). Successful completion implies that the receiving VASP was satisfied with the payer information provided and the sender VASP was satisfied with the merchant information provided. **Note** that if the payment amount exceeds the amount that requires a dual attestation signature to be submitted to the blockchain, it must be part of the on-chain transaction submitted  

### **Charge Payment Type** 
Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured.

As soon as the funds are captured, i.e. the sender agreed to the payment terms, the sender VASP is expected to submit a corresponding transaction on-chain and actually transfer the funds. 


### **Auth / Capture Payment Type**
Auth / Capture payment, as the name suggests, means that the payment is divided into two steps:
* Authorization
* Capture
 
The Authorization step ends when the funds are locked by the sender VASP so they can later be captured by the receiver VASP. Note that the capture may occur several days after a successful authorization. It is up to the receiver VASP to decide on the timing. In addition, the receiver may choose to capture only a partial amount rather than the full amount which was authorized. 

This payment type is useful for delayed fulfillment or pre-authorizing an expected amount to ensure that an amount can be captured after services are rendered. 

Off-chain negotiations for Auth / Capture payment are divided into two steps accordingly. First, off-chain negotiations will result in funds being authorized, i.e. locked by the wallet. Later, a separate off-chain negotiation triggered by the receiving VASP will capture the funds. Note that for the time being, multi-capture is not supported and there can be only a single capture request.

Successful authorization will not necessarily be followed by a successful capture. It is possible that the receiver will choose to cancel the authorization and essentially void the payment before it was captured. One possible reason to void a payment is that the products for which an amount was locked are out of stock and cannot be fulfilled.

## Sender / Receiver Interface
---
This section describes a set of functionalities / activities that should be made available by a Sender and Receiver VASPs in order to support P2M flows based on this DIP. Each functionality can be conceptually compared to an API endpoint. Similar to API documentation, it includes the expected input and output for each functionality.

## New Command Types
The following is a list of new values for the `command_type` field of the `CommandRequestObject`. Each command type denotes a step in the off-chain negotiations and specifies the data of the requests and the response 
* `GetInfoCommand` - Allows obtaining payment information based on reference id
* `InitChargeCommand` - Initializes a payment process of type `charge`
* `InitAuthorizeCommand` - Initializes a payment process of type `auth`
* `ReadyForSettlementNotification` - Notifies the payment is ready for settlement on-chain
* `AuthorizedNotification` - Notifies that payment funds are authorized (locked) for future capture
* `CaptureCommand` - Request to capture authorized (locked) funds 
* `VoidCommand` - Voids a payment
* `AbortCommand` - Aborts a payment

| Command Type |Direction| Description | Request Data | Response Data |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|[GetInfoCommand](#getinfocommand)|Sender > Receiver|By providing the object reference id the wallet can retrieve the object information from the receiving VASP. In most cases, this would be the first command sent by the wallet. The wallet is not expected to provide any payer data at this stage|Reference ID|Payment Details ; Business Data|
|[InitChargeCommand](#initchargecommand)|Sender > Receiver|This functionality allows the wallet to init the payment process based on the payment details. For example, this may occur after the customer approved the payment request|Reference ID ; Payer Data|(optional) Recipient Signature|
|[InitAuthorizeCommand](#initauthorizecommand)|Sender > Receiver|This functionality allows the wallet to init the payment process based on the payment details. For example, this may occur after the customer approved the payment request|Reference ID ; Payer Data||
|[ReadyForSettlementNotification](#readyforsettlementnotification)|Sender > Receiver|This functionality allows the wallet to indicate the payment is ready for settlement. The wallet is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after declaring it is ready|Reference ID||
|[AuthorizedNotification](#authorizednotification)|Sender > Receiver|This functionality allows the wallet to indicate funds are locked for future capture. Relevant only for Auth / Capture payments|Reference ID||
|[CaptureCommand](#capturecommand)|Receiver > Sender|This functionality allows the receiver to capture the locked (authorized) funds or part of it. Relevant only for Auth / Capture payments. This optionally includes the recipient signature for dual attestation scenario if needed|Reference ID ; (optional) Amount ; (optional) Recipient Signature||
|[VoidCommand](#voidcommand)|Receiver > Sender|This functionality allows the receiver to void the payment. For example, the merchant voided the payment because the purchased products are out of stock. Relevant only for Auth / Capture payments|Reference ID||
|[AbortCommand](#abortcommand)|Sender > Receiver / Receiver > Sender|This functionality allows both parties to abort the payment. For example, the receiver may want to abort the payment following failed risk checks|Reference ID||

## Payment Sequences
---
This section describes the expected sequences in P2M scenarios.
Each scenario is expressed using a sequence of Sender / Receiver functionality.

**Reminder:** Before this scenario starts, an exchange of a common payment identifier (Reference ID) must be completed. 

### Charge Sequence
| Step | Command Type | Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetInfoCommand|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargeCommand|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data|
|3|ReadyForSettlementNotification|Sender|The wallet indicates the payment is ready for settlement. The wallet is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after this step|

#### Charge Sequence Diagram

### Authorization Sequence (Auth / Capture)
| Step | Command Type | Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetInfoCommand|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitAuthorizeCommand|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data|
|3|AuthorizedNotification|Sender|The wallet indicates the funds are locked for a future capture|

### Capture Sequence (Auth / Capture)
IMPORTANT: Successful authorization is a precondition to capture
| Step |Command Type|Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|CaptureCommand|Receiver|The receiver requests to capture the authorized funds or part of it|
|2|ReadyForSettlementNotification|Sender|The wallet indicates the payment is ready for settlement. The wallet is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after this step|

#### Capture Sequence Diagram

### Void Sequence (Auth / Capture)
IMPORTANT: Successful authorization is a precondition to void
| Step |Command Type|Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|VoidCommand|Receiver|Receiving VASP wants to void the payment. For example, the merchant voided the payment because the purchased products are out of stock|

### Risk Checks Failed (Init Payment Error)
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|

# Appendix A - Prerequisite: Sharing Common Payment Identifier and Address

Note that this is a prerequisite for the off-chain negotiations and not a part of it.

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using Redirect URL

This URL contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier) and the wallet's website address.

The redirect URL is likely to be used in the **Web Redirect** flow which means that the customer will be redirected from the merchant's checkout page to the wallet's website to review and approve the payment. 

The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into a series of URL parameters appended to the query string.

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|redirect_url|str|N|Encoded URL used by the wallet to redirect the customer back to the merchant|

For example, for the following values:
|Field|Value|
|-|-|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|
|redirect_url|http%3A%2F%2Fsomemerchantnname.com%2Fcallbackpage|


The URL format would be:

`https://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411&redirect_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsomemerchantnname.com%2Fcallbackpage`


After parsing this request, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the customer to review and approve. 

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using QR Code

Similar to the URL, the QR code contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier).

The QR Code is likely to be used in the **QR Scan** flow, which means that the customer will use the wallet app on the mobile device to scan the QR code on the merchant's checkout page. Following the QR code scan, the wallet app will display the payment details for the customer to review and approve the payment. 

The QR code is a representation of a deeplink.
The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into the QR code deeplink. 

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-----|----|---------|-----------|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|redirect_url|str|N|Encoded URL used by the wallet to redirect the customer back to the merchant|

For example, for the following values:

|Field|Value|
|-|-|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|

The deeplink represented by QR code would be (the domain and path are examples - the real wallet domain/path should be used):

`diem://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411`

After scanning the QR code, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the customer to review and approve.
