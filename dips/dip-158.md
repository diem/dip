# Summary
This DIP leverages the off-chain protocol defined in [DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx) and extends it to enable P2M Charge payment.

This DIP defines the type of the P2M payments, corresponding requests and the payment structures. 
 
This DIP does NOT include payment flows which require funds pull pre-approval such as subscription and recurring payments. 

This DIP makes use of the `result` field added to the `CommandResponseObject` as described in [DIP-161](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-161.md)

---
# Abstract / Motivation
This DIP is an extension of the Off-Chain Protocol to support more advanced payment functionality - particularly eCommerce P2M Charge payment.
Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured (and submit a corresponding transaction on-chain and actually transfer the funds). 

## How P2M Payments Differ from P2P Transfers 
There are several key differences between the process of paying a merchant (P2M) and a simple P2P transfer:
||P2M|P2P|
|-|-|-|
|**Payer Data**|Customer details are required for **every** payment / purchase in order to perform risk checks and apply AML policies|Required only for transfers for which Travel Rule applies. i.e., over 1000 USD|
|**Payment Owner**|The merchant, i.e. the receiver of funds, "drives" the process and determines the payment details|The payer, i.e. the sender of funds, determines the nature of the transfer|
|**Reconciliation**|The merchant requires a way to correlate the transfer of funds to a payment or payment request for reconciliation purposes|No reconciliation|

---
# Glossary
For the sake of simplicity, we use the following terms:
* "Sender", "Payer", "Wallet" or "customer VASP" - The customer's wallet. It is the VASP representing the customer. This is the VASP that will send the funds and eventually will submit the on-chain transaction to the blockchain
* "Receiver", "Receiving VASP" or "Merchant VASP" - The VASP representing the merchant which receives the funds (transaction)
* "Customer" - The person who wishes to pay the merchant for goods or services
* "Reference ID", "Common Payment Identifier", "Payment Identifier" - A unique identifier of the payment. It must be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included. See also [Reference ID in DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx#terminology)
---
# Prerequisite: Sharing Payment Identifier and Receiver Address
A prerequisite for the off-chain negotiations is that both parties (sending and receiving VASPs) have shared a common payment identifier and the receiver address. This common payment identifier is required to support a successive off-chain protocol between the VASPs. 
This DIP specifies a couple of examples for exchanging identifiers between VASPs, however, there could be others. The protocol is agnostic to the method of exchanging the common payment identifier. 

See [Appendix A](#appendix-a---prerequisite-sharing-common-payment-identifier-and-address)

## High-Level Flow and Payment Types
---
The high-level flow of an eCommerce P2M payment is:
1. On the merchant's checkout page the customer chooses to pay with Diem
2. The merchant transmits the payment details to its VASP (receiver VASP) so the latter can generate a payment request with Diem  
3. The the receiver VASP generates a payment request with all details needed to identify this payment later in the process, provides it to the merchant and makes it available to the customer's Diem wallet (the customer's VASP or sender)
4. The sender VASP parses the payment request (e.g. by scanning the payment request QR) and uses the provided payment identifier to get the payment details. This is the first step of the off-chain protocol
5. The wallet then presents the requested payment details to the customer so the customer can review the payment
6. The customer approves the payment request in the wallet
7. The wallet initializes the payment protocol (off-chain) which will end (if successful) with the funds being charged. Successful completion implies that the receiving VASP was satisfied with the payer information provided and the sender VASP was satisfied with the merchant information provided. **Note** that if the payment amount exceeds the amount that requires a dual attestation signature to be submitted to the blockchain, it must be part of the on-chain transaction submitted  

### **Charge Payment Type** 
Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured.
As soon as the funds are captured, i.e. the sender agreed to the payment terms, the sender VASP is expected to submit a corresponding transaction on-chain and actually transfer the funds. 

### **Other Payment Types (future)**
Protocols supporting other eCommerce payments flows will require additional payment types which will be be defined in future DIPs.
Some examples for such flows are:
* Auth / Capture
* Subscription payment
* Recurring payments

---
## Sender / Receiver Interface
---
This section describes a set of functionalities / activities that should be made available by a Sender and Receiver VASPs in order to support P2M Charge flow based on this DIP. Each functionality can be conceptually compared to an API endpoint. Similar to API documentation, it includes the expected input and output for each functionality.

## Command Types
The following is a list of new values for the `command_type` field of the `CommandRequestObject`. Each command type denotes a step in the off-chain negotiations and specifies the data of the requests and the response 
* `GetPaymentInfo` - Allows obtaining payment information based on reference id
* `InitChargePayment` - Initializes a payment process of type `charge`
* `ReadyForSettlementNotification` - Notifies the payment is ready for settlement on-chain
* `AbortPayment` - Aborts a payment

| Command Type |Direction| Description | Request Data | Response Data |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|[GetPaymentInfo](#getpaymentinfo)|Sender > Receiver|By providing the object reference id the wallet can retrieve the object information from the receiving VASP. In most cases, this would be the first command sent by the wallet. The wallet is not expected to provide any payer data at this stage|Reference ID|Payment Details ; Business Data|
|[InitChargePayment](#initchargepayment)|Sender > Receiver|This functionality allows the wallet to init the payment process based on the payment details. For example, this may occur after the customer approved the payment request|Reference ID ; Payer Data|(optional) Recipient Signature|
|[ReadyForSettlementNotification](#readyforsettlementnotification)|Sender > Receiver|This functionality allows the wallet to indicate the payment is ready for settlement. The wallet is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after declaring it is ready|Reference ID||
|[AbortPayment](#abortpayment)|Sender > Receiver / Receiver > Sender|This functionality allows both parties to abort the payment. For example, the receiver may want to abort the payment following failed risk checks|Reference ID||

---
## Payment Sequences
---
This section describes the expected sequences in P2M scenarios.
Each scenario is expressed using a sequence of Sender / Receiver functionality.

**Reminder:** Before this scenario starts, an exchange of a common payment identifier (Reference ID) must be completed. 

### Charge Sequence
| Step | Command Type | Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargePayment|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data|
|3|ReadyForSettlementNotification|Sender|The wallet indicates the payment is ready for settlement. The wallet is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after this step|

### Risk Checks Failed (Init Payment Error)
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargePayment|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data.  Risk checks failed. Receiver will respond with PaymentCommandErrorObject where the error_code is `risk_checks_failed`|

### Invalid Command Type (Premature Settlement Error)
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|ReadyForSettlementNotification|Sender|Instead of initializing the payment, the wallet wrongly notifies that the payment is ready for settlement. Receiver will respond with PaymentCommandErrorObject where the error_code is `invalid_command_type`|

### Abort Sequence - Customer Rejected the Payment Request
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|AbortPayment|Sender|Customer decided not to approve the payment based on the information displayed. It is recommended to include a descriptive abort_message|

### Abort Sequence - Merchant Data Checks (performed by the Sender) Failed
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|InitChargePayment|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data|
|3|AbortPayment|Sender|Sender decided to abort. Can happen if the sender does not approve merchant data provided by the receiver|

### Abort Sequence - Insufficient Funds
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|GetPaymentInfo|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided. The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data|
|2|AbortPayment|Sender|After getting the payments details from the receiver, the wallet verifies the customer has sufficient funds to complete the payment. If not (and the customer cannot/does not top up the account balance), the wallet should respond with AbortPayment. It is recommended to include a descriptive abort_message|

# Appendix A - Prerequisite: Sharing Common Payment Identifier and Address

Note that this is a prerequisite for the off-chain negotiations and not a part of it.

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using Redirect URL

This URL contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier) and the wallet's website address.

The redirect URL is likely to be used in the **Web Redirect** flow which means that the customer will be redirected from the merchant's checkout page to the wallet's website to review and approve the payment. 

The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into a series of URL parameters appended to the query string.

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|redirect_url|str|N|Encoded URL used by the wallet to redirect the customer back to the merchant|

For example, for the following values:
|Field|Value|
|-|-|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|
|redirect_url|http%3A%2F%2Fsomemerchantnname.com%2Fcallbackpage|


The URL format would be:

`https://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411&redirect_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsomemerchantnname.com%2Fcallbackpage`


After parsing this request, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the customer to review and approve. 

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using QR Code

Similar to the URL, the QR code contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier).

The QR Code is likely to be used in the **QR Scan** flow, which means that the customer will use the wallet app on the mobile device to scan the QR code on the merchant's checkout page. Following the QR code scan, the wallet app will display the payment details for the customer to review and approve the payment. 

The QR code is a representation of a deeplink.
The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into the QR code deeplink. 

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-----|----|---------|-----------|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|redirect_url|str|N|Encoded URL used by the wallet to redirect the customer back to the merchant|

For example, for the following values:

|Field|Value|
|-|-|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|

The deeplink represented by QR code would be (the domain and path are examples - the real wallet domain/path should be used):

`diem://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411`

After scanning the QR code, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the customer to review and approve.
