# Contribution Guide

Our goal is to make contributing a Libra Improvment Protocol (LIP), or make changes to the [LIP website](https://lip.libra.org), easy and transparent.

## Contributing a LIP

To contribute a LIP, follow [the LIP process guidelines](https://lip.libra.org/overview#the-lip-process). For example, one way to contribute a LIP is to file a GitHub issue in this repo, gather feedback, and then, once the discussion is over, create a pull request with your LIP in the `libra/lips` folder of this repo.

## Documentation

The documentation for https://lip.libra.org is published from this repo. The site is open source, and is built using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

If you are familiar with Markdown, you can start contributing!

## Pull Requests

During the initial phase of development, we plan to only audit and review the pull requests. As the codebase stabilizes, we will be able to accept pull requests from the community.

To submit your pull request:

1. Fork the `lip` repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Create your LIP locally.
3. Complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), if you haven't already done so. See below for information about the CLA.
4. Submit your pull request.

## Contributor License Agreement

For your pull requests to be accepted by any Libra project, you will need to sign a CLA. You will need to do this only once to work on any Libra open source project. Individuals contributing on their own behalf can sign the [Individual CLA](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/contributing/individual-cla.pdf). If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, please ask them to sign the [Corporate CLA](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/contributing/corporate-cla.pdf).
