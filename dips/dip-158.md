# Summary

This DIP is an extension of the Off-Chain protocol for enabling eCommerce P2M payments (Peer To Merchant) of the following types:
* Charge
* Auth / Capture
 
This DIP extends [DIP-1](https://dip.diem.com/dip-1/) which specifies P2P payment flows (Peer To Peer).

This DIP replaces the Auth/Capture section in [DIP-8](https://dip.diem.com/dip-8/#authcapture).

This DIP does NOT include payment flows which require funds pull pre-approval such as subscription and recurring payments. 

This DIP makes use of the `result` field added to the `CommandResponseObject` as described in DIP-10

# Abstract / Motivation


This DIP is an extension of the Off-Chain Protocol to support more advanced payment functionality - particularly eCommerce P2M payments. 

## How P2M Payments Different than P2P Transfers 
There are some key differences in the process of paying a merchant (P2M) that differ from simple P2P transfer:

|      |P2M|P2P|
|------|---|---|
|**Payer Data**|Buyer details are required for **every** payment / purchase in order to perform risk checks and apply AML policies|Required only for transfers for which Travel Rule applies. i.e., over 1000 USD|
|**Payment Owner**|The merchant, i.e. the receiver of funds, "drives" the process and controls the type of payment and its timing. For example, the merchant will decide when to capture the funds and whether to capture the entire amount or only partial amount |The payer, i.e. the sender of funds, determines the nature of the transfer|
|**Reconciliation**|The merchant requires a way to correlate the transfer of funds to a payment or payment request for reconciliation purposes|No reconciliation|
|

## P2M Payment Types
There are two types of P2M payments described in this document: 

1. **Charge**. Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured 
2. **Auth / Capture**. Auth / Capture payment, as the name suggests, means that the payment is divided to two steps: Authorization and Capture. Successful Authorization implies that the funds are locked so they can later be captured

This DIP defines the type of eCommerce P2M payments, corresponding requests and the payment structures. 


---
# Synonyms

For the sake of simplicity, we use the following terms:
* "Sender", "Payer", "Wallet", "Buyer VASP" or "User VASP" - The user's wallet. It is the VASP representing the customer/buyer. This is the VASP that will send the funds and eventually will submit the on-chain transaction to the blockchain
* "Receiver", "Receiving VASP" or "Merchant VASP" - The VASP representing the merchant which receives the funds (transaction)
* "Buyer", "Customer" or "User" - The person who wishes to pay the merchant for goods or services



---
# Pre-requisite: Sharing Payment Identifier and Receiver Address

A pre-requisite for the off-chain negotiations is that both parties (sending and receiving VASPs) have managed to share a common payment identifier and the receiver address is known. This DIP specifies a couple of examples for exchanging identifiers between VASPs, however,  there could be others.

See appendix A

# P2M Off-Chain Protocol Specification
This section, including all its sub-sections, specifies the P2M payment types within the scope of this document, the required structures, payloads and the expected sequence and of calls based on this protocol.

Content:
* *High Level Flow and Payment Types*
* *New Elements and Existing Elements Extensions*
* *Sender / Receiver Interface*
* *Request / Response Payload*
* *Payment Sequences*


---
## *High-Level Flow and Payment Types*
---

The high-level flow of an eCommerce P2M payment (regardless of the type) is:
1. On the merchant's checkout page the customer chooses to pay with Diem and selects the preferred Diem wallet to use
2. The merchant's VASP (the receiver) generates a payment request with all details needed to identify this payment later in the process and makes it available to the user's Diem wallet (the user's VASP or sender)
3. The user's VASP parses the payment request (e.g. by scanning the payment request QR) and uses the provided payment identifier to get the payment details. This is the first step of the off-chain protocol
4. The wallet then presents the requested payment details to the user so the user can review the payment
5. The user approves the payment request in the wallet
6. The wallet initializes the payment protocol (off-chain) which will end (if successful) with the funds being authorized or captured (depending on the payment type). successful authorization or capture implies that the receiving VASP was satisfied with the payer information provided and the sender VASP was satisfied with the merchant information provided  

### **Charge Payment Type** 
Charge payment stipulates an immediate capture of funds. This means that a successful off-chain negotiation for such payment will result in funds being captured.

As soon as the funds are captured, i.e. the sender agreed to the payment terms, the sender VASP is expected to submit a corresponding transaction on-chain and actually transfer the funds. 


### **Auth / Capture Payment Type**
Auth / Capture payment, as the name suggests, means that the payment is divided into two steps:
* Authorization
* Capture
 
The Authorization step ends when the funds are locked by the sender VASP so they can later be captured by the receiver VASP. Note that the capture may occur several days after a successful authorization. It is up to the receiver VASP to decide on the timing. In addition, the receiver may choose to capture only a partial amount rather than the full amount which was authorized. 

This payment type is useful for delayed fulfillment or pre-authorizing an expected amount to ensure that an amount can be captured after services are rendered. 

Off-chain negotiations for Auth / Capture payment are divided into two steps accordingly. First, off-chain negotiations will result in funds being authorized, i.e. locked by the wallet. Later, a separate off-chain negotiation triggered by the receiving VASP will capture the funds. Note that for the time being, multi-capture is not supported and there can be only a single capture request.

Successful authorization will not necessarily be followed by a successful capture. It is possible that the receiver will choose to cancel the authorization and essentially void the payment before it was captured. One possible reason to void a payment is that the products for which an amount was locked are out of stock and cannot be fulfilled.

## *New Elements and Existing Elements Extensions*
---
This section specifies extensions for existing elements (e.g. new values) and introduces new ones required for P2M scenarios.


## PaymentActorObject Extension
The PaymentActorObject is extended to include the field `merchant_data` of type `MerchantDataObject`.
Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|merchant_data|MerchantDataObject|N|This element is required for some scenarios. It includes the details of the merchant to be displayed to the payer|
|

## PaymentActor Status Enum Extension
The following values are added to the status enum of [PaymentActor](https://dip.diem.com/dip-1/#paymentactorobject) object:

* `authorized` - This means the actor has performed all required tasks and funds are locked for a future capture. Note that the actual lock is done by the wallet (sender), so for the receiver this status means that all risk checks were successful and it is willing to accept the payment. 
* `needs_init_data` - This means the actor requires basic data to initialize the payment. For the receiver, this status means that the payer data is required. For the sender, it means that the merchant data is required  

For completeness purposes, the full list of values is: 
* `none`
* `needs_kyc_data`
* `ready_for_settlement`
* `abort`
* `authorized`
* `soft_match`
* `needs_init_data`

Allowed transition relevant for P2M:

| Current Status | Next Status | Transition Comments |
|-|-|-|
| none | needs_init_data |Initial transition. Most common for P2M scenarios in which the actor requires additional data to initialize the payment|
| needs_init_data | ready_for_settlement | All required tasks were performed and the payment is ready for settlement |
| needs_init_data | authorized | All required tasks were performed and the funds are ready to be locked |
| authorized | ready_for_settlement | Funds captured |
| authorized | abort | Payment was voided |
| needs_init_data | abort | Payment aborted before initial data was verified |
| none | abort | Payment aborted before initialization |
| none | ready_for_settlement | All required tasks were performed and the payment is ready for settlement. It may happen when no payer data is required |
| none | authorized |  All required tasks were performed and the funds are ready to be locked. It may happen when no payer data is required |
| ready_for_settlement | abort | One party aborted the payment even though the other party already notified it is ready to settle the payment. For example, it may happen if the sender does not approve merchant data provided by the receiver |
|

### AbortCodeEnum Extension

Several P2M scenarios require adding the following values to the AbortCode Enum:
* `void` - This abort code should be used for voiding a payment that was previously authorized. For example, the merchant voided the payment because the purchased products are out of stock. It is expected that the sender VASP will respond with void code as a sign of agreement
* `risk_checks_failed` - This abort code should be used when the risk checks performed based on the payer information failed

For completeness purposes, the full list of values of the abort code enum is:
* `rejected`
* `void`
* `risk_checks_failed`


## PaymentActionObject Extension

The Auth / Capture payment requires the following additions to the [PaymentActionObject](https://dip.diem.com/dip-1/#paymentactionobject):

* A new field called `valid_until` added to the PaymentActionObject. This is a unix timestamp indicating until when the payment can be authorized. Once this time has been reached, the payment cannot be authorized and funds cannot be locked
* The action enum now includes "auth" and "capture" as allowed values

For completeness purposes, the PaymentActionObject now becomes:

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-----|----|---------|-----------|
| amount | uint | Y | Amount of the transfer.  Base units are the same as for on-chain transactions for this currency.  For example, if DiemUSD is represented on-chain where "1" equals 1e-6 dollars, then "1" equals the same amount here.  For any currency, the on-chain mapping must be used for amounts. |
| currency | enum | Y | One of the supported on-chain currency types, e.g. XUS|
| action | enum | Y | Populated in the request.  This value indicates the requested action to perform. For immediate capture and P2P transfer, "charge" is used.  For auth and capture, "auth" and "capture" are now available. "capture" can only be performed after a valid "auth" |
| valid_until | uint | N | Unix timestamp indicating until when the payment can be authorized. Once this time has been reached, the payment cannot be authorized and funds cannot be locked. |
| timestamp | uint | Y | Unix timestamp indicating the time that the payment Command was created.
|

```
{
    "amount": 100000000,
    "currency": "XUS",
    "action": "auth",
    "valid_until": 74000,
    "timestamp": 72322,
}
```

## Additional Command Types
The following is a list of new values for the `command_type` field of the `CommandRequestObject`. Each command type denotes a step in the off-chain negotiations and specifies the data of the requests and the response 
* `InfoCommand` - Allows obtianing payment information based on reference id
* `InitCommand` - Initializes the payment process
* `ReadyCommand` - Notifies the payment is ready for settlement on-chain
* `AuthorizedCommand` - Notifies that payment funds are authorized (locked) for future capture
* `CaptureCommand` - Request to capture previously authorized (locked) funds 
* `VoidCommand` - Voids a payment
* `AbortCommand` - Aborts a payment

Accordingly, the following list specifies additional values for `_ObjectType` field of  `CommandObject`
* `InfoCommand` 
* `InitCommand` 
* `ReadyCommand`
* `AuthorizedCommand` 
* `CaptureCommand`
* `VoidCommand`
* `AbortCommand`

## *Sender / Receiver Interface*
---

This section describes a set of functionalities / activities that should be made available by a Sender and Receiver VASPs in order to support P2M flows based on this DIP. Each functionality can be conceptually compared to an API endpoint. Similar to API documentation, it includes the expected input and output for each functionality.

## *Payment Sequences*
---

This section describes the expected sequences in P2M scenarios.
Each scenario is expressed using a sequence of Sender / Receiver functionality.

**Reminder:** The step of exchanging a common payment identifier has been fulfilled

### Charge Sequence

| Step | Functionality | Command Type | Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|GET_INFO|InfoCommand|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided (i.e. the common payment identifier). The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|INIT_PAYMENT|InitCommand|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data. For a successful flow, the receiver will respond with ready_for_settlement status|
|3|NOTIFY_READY|ReadyCommand|Sender|The wallet indicates the payment is ready for settlement. The wallet is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after this step|
| 

### Authorization Sequence (Auth / Capture)


| Step | Functionality | Command Type | Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|GET_INFO|InfoCommand|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided (i.e. the common payment identifier). The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|INIT_PAYMENT|InitCommand|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data. For a successful flow, the receiver will respond with authorized status|
|3|NOTIFY_AUTHORIZED|AuthorizedCommand|Sender|The wallet indicates the funds are locked for a future capture|
| 


### Capture Sequence (Auth / Capture)

IMPORTANT: Successful authorization is a pre-condition to capture

| Step |Functionality|Command Type|Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|CAPTURE_PAYMENT|CaptureCommand|Receiver|The receiver requests to capture the authorized funds|
|2|NOTIFY_READY|ReadyCommand|Sender|The wallet indicates the payment is ready for settlement. The wallet is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after this step|
|

### Abort Sequence - Customer Rejected the Payment Request

| Step | Functionality |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|GET_INFO|InfoCommand|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided (i.e. the common payment identifier). The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|ABORT_PAYMENT|AbortCommand|Sender|Customer rejected the payment request|
| 

### Void Sequence (Auth / Capture)

IMPORTANT: Successful authorization is a pre-condition to void

| Step |Functionality|Command Type|Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|VOID_PAYMENT|VoidCommand|Receiver|Receiving VASP wants to void the payment. For example, the merchant voided the payment because the purchased products are out of stock|
|

### Abort Sequence - Risk Checks Failed

| Step | Functionality |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|GET_INFO|InfoCommand|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided (i.e. the common payment identifier). The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|INIT_PAYMENT|InitCommand|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data.  Risk checks failed. Receiver will respond with abort status|
| 


### Abort Sequence - Merchant Data Checks (performed by the Sender) Failed

| Step | Functionality |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|GET_INFO|InfoCommand|Sender|The wallet requests payment details using the reference id provided (i.e. the common payment identifier). The receiver will respond with the payment details and merchant data. The wallet will display the payment details so the customer can approve or reject|
|2|INIT_PAYMENT|InitCommand|Sender|Following customer approval the wallet initializes the payment process and sends the payer data. The receiver will respond with appropriate success status|
|3|ABORT_PAYMENT|AbortCommand|Sender|Sender decided to abort. Can happen if the sender does not approve merchant data provided by the receiver|
|

# Appendix A - Pre-requisite: Sharing Common Identifier and Address

Note that this is a pre-requisite for the off-chain negotiations and not a part of it.

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using Redirect URL

This URL contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier) and the wallet's website address.

The redirect URL is likely to be used in the **Web Redirect** flow which means that the user will be redirected from the merchant's checkout page to the wallet's website to review and approve the payment. 

The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into a series of URL parameters appended to the query string.

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-----|----|---------|-----------|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|



For example, for the following values:



|Field|Value|
|-----|-----|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|
|

The URL format would be:

`https://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411`


After parsing this request, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the user to review and approve. 

## Acquire Payment Identifier and Receiver Address Using QR Code

Similar to the URL, the QR code contains the payment reference id (i.e. the common payment identifier).

The QR Code is likely to be used in the **QR Scan** flow, which means that the user will use the wallet app on the mobile device to scan the QR code on the merchant's checkout page. Following the QR code scan, the wallet app will display the payment details for the user to review and approve the payment. 

The QR code is a representation of a deeplink.
The table below specifies the fields that should be encoded into the QR code deeplink. 

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-----|----|---------|-----------|
|vasp_address|str|Y|Address of receiving VASP. The address is encoded using bech32. For Diem addresses format, refer to the "account identifiers" section in [DIP-5](https://dip.diem.com/dip-5/#account-identifiers).|
|reference_id|str|Y|A unique identifier of this payment. It should be a UUID according to RFC4122 with "-"'s included.|
|


For example, for the following values:

|Field|Value|
|-----|-----|
|vasp_address|dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh| 
|reference_id|ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411|
|

The deeplink represented by QR code would be (the domain and path are examples - the real wallet domain/path should be used):

`diem://some-diem-wallet.com/pay?vasp_address=dm1pgxah7pxhzljvp3p4m9g0m3tm0qqqqqqqqqqqqqqgyftgh&reference_id=ad8d888a-1791-4b63-98e5-6f1d6ddb4411`


After scanning the QR code, the wallet can request the payment details from the receiving VASP and display them to the user to review and approve.
