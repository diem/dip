# Overview

This DIP describes an optional result field in Off-Chain command response, and is an extension of [DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx).

Both the Off-Chain Protocol and Travel Rule Exchange (or PaymentCommand) are defined in DIP-1. The Off-Chain Protocol in its current definition lacks a way to return a complex result outside of a success or a failure. Many types of communication benefit from having richer information in responses that may prevent the need for another message exchange, leading to simpler protocol and reduced latency.

In order to support this, the `CommandResponseObject` can leverage an optional `result` field. The `result` field, if defined, must contain `_ObjectType` that uniquely defines other fields within the result.

Here's an example from DIP-10:
```
{
   "_ObjectType": "CommandResponseObject",
    "status": "success",
    "result": {
	    "_ObjectType": "ReferenceIDCommandResponse",
	    "receiver_address": "dm1p7ujcndcl7nudzwt8fglhx6wxn08kgs5tm6mz4us2vfufk",
    },
    "cid": "12ce83f6-6d18-0d6e-08b6-c00fdbbf085a",
}
```

**CommandResponseObject:**

| Field 	     | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	     |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| _ObjectType    | str      | Y             | The fixed string `CommandResponseObject`. |
| status         | str      | Y             | Either `success` or `failure`. |
| error          | [OffChainErrorObject](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx#offchainerrorobject) | N | Details of the error when status == "failure" |
| result         | Object   | N | An optional JSON object that may be defined when status == "success". |
| cid            | str      | N | The Command identifier to which this is a response. Must be a UUID according to [RFC4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) with "-"'s included and must match the 'cid' of the CommandRequestObject. This field must be set unless the request to which this is responding is unparseable. |
