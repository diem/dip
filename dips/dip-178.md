# Summary
This DIP leverages the off-chain protocol defined in [DIP-1](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-1.mdx) and extends it to enable P2M Refund payment.

This DIP defines the protocol commands, payloads and structures. 
 
This DIP makes use of the `result` field added to the `CommandResponseObject` as described in [DIP-161](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-161.md)

This DIP makes use of some of the commands described in [DIP-158](https://github.com/diem/dip/blob/main/dips/dip-158.md)

# Abstract / Motivation
This DIP is an extension of the Off-Chain Protocol to support refunds.
Refund payment is used by businesses to reimburse customers with the full, or partial amout of a previous payment made by the customer to the business.

---
# Glossary
For the sake of simplicity, we use the following terms:
* "Wallet" or "Customer VASP" - The customer's wallet. It is the VASP representing the customer. In a refund scenario, this is the VASP that will receive the funds 
* "Merchant VASP" - The VASP representing the merchant. In a refund scenario, this is the VASP that will send the funds and eventually submit the on-chain transaction to the blockchain
* "Customer" - The person who wishes to pay the merchant for goods or services


---
# P2M Refund Off-Chain Protocol Specification
This section specifies the required structures, payloads and expected sequence of calls based on this protocol.

Content:
* [High Level Flow](#-high-level-flow)
* [Interface](#-interface)
* [Refund Sequences](#-refund-sequences)
* [Request / Response Payload](#-request--response-payload)
* [Structures](#-structures)

---
## High-Level Flow
---
The high-level flow of a refund payment is:
1. A refund flow starts with either (a) The merchant transmits a refund request with the required details to its VASP or (b) the merchant VASP itself triggers a refund payment     
2. The merchant VASP will init a refund payment and send the details to the customer VASP (probably after performing some basic validations)
3. The customer VASP will verify the refund details provided, and if all is in order, will indicate it is ready to accept the refund. **Note** that if the refund amount exceeds the amount that requires dual attestation signature, the customer VASP must provide the signature as part ot its response, so the merchant VASP can later inlcude it in the on-chain transaction 
4. The merchant VASP submits a transaction on-chain and in parallel notify the customer VASP the refund is ready for settlement. Final validation will occur before this step (for example, verify the requested refund amount is not greater than the amount of original payment)

---
## Interface
---
This section describes a set of functionalities / activities that should be made available by the different VASPs in order to support P2M Refund flow based on this DIP. Each functionality can be conceptually compared to an API endpoint. Similar to API documentation, it includes the expected input and output for each functionality.

## Command Types
The following is a list of new and existing values for the `command_type` field of the `CommandRequestObject`. Each command type denotes a step in the refund payment off-chain negotiations and specifies the data of the requests and the response 
* `InitRefundPayment` - Initializes a refund payment
* `RefundReadyForSettlementNotification` - Notifies the payment is ready for settlement on-chain
* `AbortRefund` - Aborts a payment

| Command Type |Direction| Description | Request Data | Response Data |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|[InitRefundPayment](#initrefundpayment)|Merchant VASP > Customer VASP|This functionality allows the merchant VASP to init the refund. For example, this may occur after the merchant requested its VASP to refund the customer due to some items being out of stock|Reference ID ; Refund ID ; (optional) Amount|(optional) Recipient Signature|
|[RefundReadyForSettlementNotification](#refundreadyforsettlementnotification)|Merchant VASP > Customer VASP|This functionality allows the Merchant VASP to indicate the refund is ready for settlement. The merchant VASP is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after declaring it is ready|Reference ID ; Refund ID||
|[AbortRefund](#abortrefund)|Any|This functionality allows both parties to abort the refund|Reference ID ; Refund ID||

---
## Refund Sequences
---
This section describes the expected sequences in P2M refund scenario.

**Reminder:** Successful refund from the business to the customer requires a previous payment from the customer to the merchant. 

### Successful Refund Sequence
| Step | Command Type | Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|InitRefundPayment|Merchant VASP|Merchant VASP initializes the refund. Customer VASP will respond it is willing to accept the refund|
|2|RefundReadyForSettlementNotification|Merchant VASP|The merchant VASP indicates the refund is ready for settlement. The VASP is expected to submit a transaction on-chain immediately before or after this step|

### Payment not Found (Payment Reference ID Does not Exist)
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|InitRefundPayment|Merchant VASP|Merchant VASP initializes the refund. Customer VASP does not find the payment reference ID provided and respond with PaymentCommandErrorObject where the error_code is `reference_id_not_found`|


### Invalid Command Type (Premature Settlement Error)
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|RefundReadyForSettlementNotification|Sender|Instead of initializing the refund, the merchant VASP wrongly notifies that the refund is ready for settlement. Customer VASP will respond with PaymentCommandErrorObject where the error_code is `invalid_command_type`|

### Abort Sequence - Parallel Refunds
| Step |Command Type| Triggered by | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|1|InitRefundPayment|Merchant VASP|Merchant VASP initializes the refund. Customer VASP will respond it is willing to accept the refund|
|2|AbortRefund|Merchant VASP|The merchant VASP decides to abort the refund. Can happen in a race condition where a previous refund for the same funds executed before the current one|

## Structures
---

## RefundActionObject
Information about the refund amount and currency.

|Field|Type|Required?|Description|
|-----|----|---------|-----------|
| amount | uint | N |The amount of the refund. If not provided, the remaining amount of the original payment, that has not yet been refunded, will be refunded|
| currency | enum | N |One of the supported on-chain currency types, e.g. XUS. If amount is provided, the currency must be provided|
| action | [Action enum](#action-enum) | Y |The value `refund` must be used|
| valid_until | uint | N | Unix timestamp indicating until when the refund can be completed. Once this time has been reached, an attempt to complete the refund and transfer the funds will be rejected. One should consider limiting this period to several minutes (e.g. 3 minutes) which should suffice for the customer VASP to approve or reject the refund request|
| timestamp | uint | Y | Unix timestamp indicating the time that the refund command was created|

```
{
    "amount": 100000000,
    "currency": "XUS",
    "action": "refund",
    "valid_until": 74000,
    "timestamp": 72322,
}
```
### Action Enum
The following values are allowed for the Action Enum
* `refund`


## PaymentCommandErrorObject
This element is used to indicate that the command execution ended with an error. Successful command executions must NOT include this element.
 
| Field | Type | Required? | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| error_code |[ErrorCode enum](#errorcode-enum)| N | This field is used to specify the reason for the error|
| error_message | str | N | Additional details about this error|
```
"payment_command_error": {
  "error_code": "reference_id_not_found",
  "error_message": "Payment reference id was not found"
}
```
This element can be added to any command response under the result object (if the command execution was not successful).
For example, a response of GetPaymentInfo in which the refernce_id provided was not found by the receiver:
```
{
  "_ObjectType": "CommandResponseObject",
  "status": "success",
  "cid": "12ce83f6-6d18-0d6e-08b6-c00fdbbf085a",
  "result": {
    "_ObjectType": "PaymentCommandErrorObject",
    "payment_command_error": {
      "error_code": "reference_id_not_found",
      "error_message": "Payment reference id was not found"
    }
  }
}
```
### ErrorCode Enum
* `reference_id_not_found`
* `risk_checks_failed`
* `missing_information`
* `payment_type_mismatch` 
* `invalid_command_type`
* `unspecified_error`

Note that the list of error codes above is non exhaustive. A VASP may choose to use values not specified in this list.
