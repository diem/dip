Libra Improvement Proposals (LIPs) offer the Libra developer community a way to participate in advancing the features and functioning of the Libra payment network (LPN), either by proposing a change or engaging in discussion about a proposal.

To submit or modify a LIP please refer to the instructions outlined on [lip.libra.org](https://lip.libra.org).

# Website

The Libra LIP website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

### Setup

```
$ yarn
```

### Run Locally

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
