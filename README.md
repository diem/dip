Libra Improvement Proposals (LIPs) offer the Libra developer community a way to participate in advancing the features and functioning of the Libra payment network (LPN), either by proposing a change or engaging in discussion about a proposal.

To submit or modify a LIP please refer to the instructions outlined on [lip.libra.org](https://lip.libra.org).
